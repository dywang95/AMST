# AMST
Aluminum profile surface defects (APSDs) significantly impact product performance and safety, necessitating efficient and accurate inspection methods. Traditional high-resolution imaging and deep learning models are resource-intensive, posing challenges for portable devices. This paper proposes an Adaptive Mask Swin Transformer (AMST) for efficient super-resolution (SR) of APSD images. AMST introduces an adaptive mask module (AMM) to selectively process high-frequency defect regions, enhancing feature extraction while reducing computational cost. An efficient feature enhancement module (EFEM) further improves performance by integrating non-local and local information. Extensive experiments on the newly introduced APSDs-SR dataset demonstrate that AMST achieves state-of-the-art SR performance with reduced parameters and floating-point operations. Additionally, AMSTâ€™s SR results facilitate downstream tasks such as defect classification and detection.
